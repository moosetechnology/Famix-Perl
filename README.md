# Famix-Perl

A Famix meta-model and a parser for the [Perl programming language](https://www.perl.org/).

The parser is based on [Tree-Sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) and a [Perl tree-sitter grammar](https://github.com/tree-sitter-perl/tree-sitter-perl).

This was made possible, thanks to the very nice project [Pharo Tree-Sitter](https://github.com/Evref-BL/Pharo-Tree-Sitter).
Well done guys!
